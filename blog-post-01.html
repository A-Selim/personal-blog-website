        <p class="paragraph">
            Before I begin, let me tell you this: There’s already a piece with a similar headline on Medium. While this was a very insightful piece, what I’m about to describe is completely different.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The focus of the present article isn’t to share tips and advice — but actionable habits every programmer can follow.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I begin here by crediting Stephen Covey, the American educator who coined the famous “7 habits of highly effective” trademark phrase.
        </p>
        <h2 class="part-title">Who Is an Effective Programmer?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Anyone can aim to be a productive programmer. Productivity drives the industry. However, it’s a dream that drives an effective programmer — a dream to deliver something beyond what’s presently possible.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Programmers often compete in programming competitions. There, they’re ranked for accuracy levels (number of test cases passed), execution speeds of their programs, code coverage, and speed of completion.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            They practice on LeetCode/HackerRank to get hired by their dream employers (FAAMG and their ilk).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But that rarely tells how effective a programmer is with respect to his overall contribution to the software world.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Imagine Dennis Ritchie, creator of C, participating in a TopCoder SRM. Brian Acton, the creator of WhatsApp, was rejected by Facebook and Twitter.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            If Nobel or Booker Prizes were given for programming, what’d be the traits programmers would be judged on? How long would the evaluation span be, what would be the criterion, and which unsung heroes would emerge as winners?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Here’s the list of things effective programmers do on a regular basis to contribute the most to the software world.
        </p>
        <h2 class="part-title">Observe</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Programming wasn’t downloaded from space. Humans created hardware and invented software to run on it.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Then they developed programming languages.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            They did it to instruct machines using human-understandable semantics. Software is aimed to solve a problem faced by humans. Without real-world correlation, devising software solutions would be a task limited only to genius mathematicians.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            You can’t construct an effective software workflow without understanding the underlying real-world workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Can you observe producer-consumer patterns in passengers boarding and getting off a train? Can you see a hash table indexed by street names and zip codes in postal addresses? Can you spot a break statement every time someone makes a final move in a board game?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            If you can do this, you’ll do better converting real-world problems into programming lingo. Conversion of problems into structures that computers can understand marks the first very crucial step in software development.
        </p>
        <h2 class="part-title">Read</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            RTFM respectfully(!) means Read The Freaking (/Factory) Manual.
            In the early days of Stack Overflow, this was a highly (ab)used phrase to educate newbie questioners on how to refine their programming questions.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Productive developers begin by visiting Stack Overflow to chase their sprint goals. In 70% of the cases, this is the most pragmatic choice.
                
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            There is nothing new under the sun; why reinvent the wheel?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But some programmers do it and end up inventing faster vehicles. Reading cultivates creativity — a trait that’s rare in the majority of programmers today.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Effective developers try to go higher by aiming to reinvent the wheel. They try to embrace the beast when there are not enough forum answers available around a framework or SDK.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            They do it by going through verbose and difficult to read manuals/documentation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            They do it by studying research papers, mathematical formulae, pseudocodes, or coding journals. Microsoft TechnNet and Apple’s Technote archive used to be great places for expert developers to publish and discuss possibilities, design guidelines, and bugs. Software journals of the IEEE and Dr. Dobbs were the favorite bookmarks for architects and solution developers in the last decade.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Even while using Google, great programmers expand their resources by trying interrelated search terms or searching deep within proprietary forums, obsolete docs, or unpopular open-source repos.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            In the absence of a readily available solution, they aim to roll out their novel solutions by following in the footsteps of the programming language creators, book authors, or framework developers.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            They use the acquired knowledge not only to deliver the task at hand but also to evolve personally as a programmer and continually iterate on the products already delivered.
        </p>
        <h2 class="part-title">Design</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Rookie developers always jump on coding a problem. This is because they’re often anxious to validate their skills. They‘ a’re eager to know whether they can develop it.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Effective developers, on the contrary, try to see through a challenge in a much bigger context.They visualize the larger problem. They devise the solution around that problem, instead of focusing their energies on just the challenge.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Design is a step in the software-development process. But it’s a habit in the life of effective programmers.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Their ways are various and resourceful: scribbling on whiteboards, brainstorming with colleagues, making presentations, asking in forums, or conjuring up the flow charts.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            They spend plenty of time to know:
        </p>
        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>
                Does the problem, indeed, deserve to be solved?
            </li>
            <li>
                If yes, how much of it must be automated?
            </li>
            <li>
                Does it really require technology? (Many problems don’t — e.g., consult, customer care, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
                If yes, how many resources and how much time is required to develop a programming solution? And is it feasible given the assets at your disposal
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="part-title">Document</h2>

            This is a manuscript of “Al-jabr” (treaties on Algebra) written by al-Khwarizmi, the Persian polymath who coined the term algorithm.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Imagine the world without ancient manuscripts.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Knowledge was available to modern scientists and engineers, and they could build computers because our ancestors were wise enough to document their discoveries even in the absence of technology.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Good developers develop a perfect solution and deliver it.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Great developers document every decision to prepare for unforeseen disruptions. They often do it to invest in future transitions. They always do it to transfer their knowledge to forthcoming stakeholders and programmers.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            They document with perfection in the language (universal and well-known). They document with relevance in format (markdown, functional spec, technical spec, activity diagrams, PPT, or flowcharts).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Often, their documentation footnotes result into quality manuals for the organization or the programming books of the future.
        </p>
        <h2 class="part-title">Decouple</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            While this could be a step in the design process, decoupling is a habit that comes in handy in every iteration of the software development life cycle (SDLC), and yet very few developers profess in it.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            When I was developing my first large software project, I ended up writing spaghetti code. My networking helper knew about my 23 business objects. My UI knew about my models. I had no layer in-between to tackle the data conversion and abstraction required to maintain it gracefully.	
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            When I revisited my code after a two-month break, nothing made sense. I ended up rewriting everything.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Lesson learned?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            There’s a method to developing a software megaproject. It’s called decoupling. It rests on abstraction, one of the founding cornerstone of object-oriented programming. I described its importance here:

        <p class="paragraph">
            Great developers avoid spaghetti code from the beginning and at every step during maintenance. They carry the single responsibility principle (SRP) on their fingertips. They make reusable functions abstracted from irrelevant data. Even past achieving the functional objective, they iterate until:
        </p>
        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>
                All redundant code is removed
            </li>
            <li>
                Each object is responsible for a singular task
            </li>
            <li>
                Every object is talking to a very limited and specific number of objects, and there are no cross-dependencies
            </li>
        </ul>

            Hack it till you make it.
        </p>

            Every good programmer can remember breaking a radio, a remote control, or dad’s watch.

        <p class="paragraph">
           Breaking a problem into a thousand pieces, discovering each piece’s place within a huge machinery, assembling them again to make a faulty piece, breaking and constructing it again, and finally succeeding to recreate it — doesn’t this remind you of putting up a full-stack project?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
           If not, it’s surely similar to putting up a CI batch file.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But then they say:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="paragraph">
            That’s the rule many successful managers follow. And it’s often wise, too, considering the financial implications of changing existing behavior. Even though the experimentation is aimed at a dev environment, a good programmer’s time is a trade-off many managers want to avoid.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Yet, a programmer worth his salt often works at odd hours to catch a rainbow in the rainy sky. He wants to go beyond existing boundaries, break existing routines, and recreate things to make a better world around him.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            He often ends up innovating it for the world.
        </p>
        <h2 class="part-title">Test</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Despite plenty of available test frameworks, many developers rarely write test cases. Sometimes, they don’t even take the pain to step through every line of code they wrote.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Resulting bugs turn into bug cycles, quick fixes, and plummeting team motivation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
           Great developers often write test cases before they develop or soon after a feature freeze. They take extra care covering up the boundary conditions. They cover every possible exception type. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            While they’re not number freaks and chase 100%, they ensure the maximum possible code coverage without help from a code-coverage tool.
        </p>
        <h2 class="part-title">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Anyone can aim to be a productive programmer. At the end of the day, productivity feeds our mouths, and it keeps the industry alive by continually delivering valuable software.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            However, productivity only drives the industry. It’s a dream that drives an effective programmer — a dream to deliver something beyond what is presently possible.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Techniques make you a good programmer.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Habits make you an effective one. Being a great one will be a side effect.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Cultivating habits to be an effective programmer is a dream worth chasing after.
